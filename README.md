## Project Brief
You have been tasked with creating a wiki-style website for front-end developers to store information about coding including syntax, and examples of how to create elements for a site.
Here are a list of functional requirements:

- All users should be able to see a list of posts.
- All users should be able to search for a specific post. You can use client-side filtering, or use the search parameter on the API itself.
- A user should be able to log in
- A user who hasn’t logged in shouldn’t be able to edit any of the entries on the site.
- A logged in user should be able to create a post
- A logged in user should be able to update a post
-A logged in user should be able to delete a post

You should use WordPress as a headless CMS to manage the content. It’s important to note that the editing of the content should happen on the front-end built by you, not the WordPress admin panel. You need to be making PUT and POST requests yourself to maintain the content on the site, and be fetching content from the WordPress REST API.

The API that you create and serve through WordPress is one part of the project. You’re just using WordPress for the API it gives you.

The second part of the project is the front-end code; a completely distinct project.
